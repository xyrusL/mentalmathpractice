                    This is a simple mental math practice application. It allows users to practice addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
                    I made this site for the purpose of my learning while also using the latest technology with AI. I know there are some bugs and problems here.
                    The application is built using React and Bootstrap. It is designed to be simple and easy to use.
                    The goal of the application is to help users improve their mental math skills. 
                    This application is suitable for all ages. Thank you for using it ❤️!
